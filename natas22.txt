From the site's source provided, it seems that with the parameter 
'revelio', the site will check for admin credential, and if the key-value
pair (admin, 1) does not exist in $_SESSION. The site will be redirect back 
to the original site.

"""
<?
session_start();

if(array_key_exists("revelio", $_GET)) {
    // only admins can reveal the password
    if(!($_SESSION and array_key_exists("admin", $_SESSION) and $_SESSION["admin"] == 1)) {
    header("Location: /");
    }
}
?>
"""

However, the code below gives us a hint that the url link contains 'revelio'
(if not redirected) will reveal the password for level 23.

"""
<?
    if(array_key_exists("revelio", $_GET)) {
    print "You are an admin. The credentials for the next level are:<br>";
    print "<pre>Username: natas23\n";
    print "Password: <censored></pre>";
    }
?>
"""

I believe this is a HORIZONTAL ACCESS CONTROL VULNERABILITY, where we 
can perform the priviledge escalation based on url redirection.

Using burp suite, we can capture the reposnse from server before it is 
redirect back to our first site.
