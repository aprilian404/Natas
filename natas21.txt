// if update was submitted, store it

The code above from natas21-experimenter.natas21.labs.overthewire.org means
whenever the submitted request contain "submit", $_REQUEST will update its
array with all the given key and value in the http request.
We can exploit this and pass the (admin,1) pairs to $_REQUEST.

The original parameters are: 
align=center&fontsize=100%25&bgcolor=yellow&submit=Update

We will tamper this request by replace with our needed parameter:
admin=1&submit=Update

Add '?debug' to the url to confirm our parameters passed to $_REQUEST.

Then redirect current page back to natas21.natas21labsoverthewire.org
Since the two pages are colocate /** not so sure what exactly that means 
but may be the two pages share the same Session id ? **/
we are able to satisfy the 'if' condition ($_SESSION and array_key_exists("admin", $_SESSION) and $_SESSION["admin"] == 1)
in the print_credential() function and the password in natas 21 is shown.
